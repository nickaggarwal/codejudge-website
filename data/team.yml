      name : "Akhil Mittal"

      frontend technologies (ExtJs, AngularJs), databases (SQL/NoSQL), search engines (Elasticsearch) and cache (Redis) will accelerate our journey. 
      This obsession over architecture, code quality and design attracted him towards Code-judge where not only a code is scored (based on various code quality and design metrics) but also the tedious task of reviewing it manually (which is being done till date) is automated."
